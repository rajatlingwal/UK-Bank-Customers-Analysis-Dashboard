The dashboard highlights distinct customer demographics and banking behaviors across different regions within the UK. In England, the predominant customer profile consists of white-collar workers, comprising 70% of the demographic. Conversely, Scottish customers are primarily males in their late 40s and early 50s, with a lower representation of white-collar workers compared to England. Welsh customers exhibit above-average balances, particularly in the mid-sized range. In Northern Ireland, the customer base is predominantly younger females, with a lower representation of white-collar workers.
